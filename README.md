#### Problem Statement:
- The current carbon credit market is highly fragmented and lacks transparency. This makes it difficult for buyers and sellers to find each other and transact. The lack of transparency also makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of carbon credits. This is a problem because carbon credits are a key tool in the fight against climate change. They allow companies to offset their carbon emissions by buying credits from projects that reduce emissions. This helps to create a financial incentive for companies to reduce their emissions and invest in clean energy. However, the lack of transparency in the carbon credit market makes it difficult for companies to trust that the credits they are buying are legitimate. This is a problem because it reduces the effectiveness of carbon credits as a tool for fighting climate change.
