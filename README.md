#### Problem Statement:
- The current carbon credit market is highly fragmented and lacks transparency. This makes it difficult for buyers and sellers to find each other and transact. The lack of transparency also makes it difficult to verify the authenticity of carbon credits. This is a problem because carbon credits are a key tool in the fight against climate change. They allow companies to offset their carbon emissions by buying credits from projects that reduce emissions. This helps to create a financial incentive for companies to reduce their emissions and invest in clean energy. However, the lack of transparency in the carbon credit market makes it difficult for companies to trust that the credits they are buying are legitimate. This is a problem because it reduces the effectiveness of carbon credits as a tool for fighting climate change.

#### Solution:
- Our solution is to create a blockchain-based platform that allows buyers and sellers to transact carbon credits in a transparent and secure way. The platform will use blockchain technology to create a tamper-proof record of each credit, including information about its origin and the emissions reductions it represents. This will make it easy for buyers to verify the authenticity of the credits they are buying. The platform will also use smart contracts to automate the process of buying and selling credits, reducing the need for intermediaries and making transactions faster and more efficient. This will make it easier for buyers and sellers to find each other and transact. The platform will also include a marketplace where buyers and sellers can list their credits and connect with each other. This will create a more liquid and efficient market for carbon credits, making it easier for companies to offset their emissions and invest in clean energy.

#### Tech Stack:
- Frontend: React
- Backend: Nestjs
- Blockchain: Optimism

#### Features:
- Create a tamper-proof record of each credit, including information about its origin and the emissions reductions it represents.

#### Future Scope:
- The platform will also use smart contracts to automate the process of buying and selling credits, reducing the need for intermediaries and making transactions faster and more efficient.
